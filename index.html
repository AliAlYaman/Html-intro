            Hello! My name is Ali Al Yaman, and I am currently in my third year of university, majoring in Computer Science. I am 20 years old and have a keen interest in technology and problem-solving. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, which provides me with a great way to relax and gain new perspectives. Additionally, I occasionally indulge in playing video games, which I find to be a fun and engaging way to unwind.
            
            To further sharpen my skills and knowledge in computer science, I often solve problems on LeetCode. This practice helps me improve my coding abilities and keeps me challenged. My academic journey and extracurricular activities have fueled my passion for learning and developing innovative solutions in the field of technology.
