      <p>
        Hello! My name is Ali Al Yaman, and I am currently in my third year of
        university, majoring in Computer Science. I am 20 years old and have a
        keen interest in technology and problem-solving. In my free time, I
        enjoy reading books, which provides me with a great way to relax and
        gain new perspectives. Additionally, I occasionally indulge in playing
        video games, which I find to be a fun and engaging way to unwind. To
        further sharpen my skills and knowledge in computer science, I often
        solve problems on LeetCode. This practice helps me improve my coding
        abilities and keeps me challenged. My academic journey and
        extracurricular activities have fueled my passion for learning and
        developing innovative solutions in the field of technology.
